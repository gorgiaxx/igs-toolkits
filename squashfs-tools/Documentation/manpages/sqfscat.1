.SH NAME
sqfscat - tool to cat files from a squashfs filesystem to stdout
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sqfscat
[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR] \fI\,FILESYSTEM \/\fR[\fI\,list of files to cat to stdout\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.
It uses either gzip/xz/lzo/lz4/zstd compression to compress both files, inodes
and directories.  Inodes in the system are very small and all blocks are
packed to minimise data overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported
up to a maximum of 1Mbytes (default block size 128K).

Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained
block device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low overhead is
needed.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "Runtime options:"
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-version\fR
print version, licence and copyright information.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR NUMBER, \fB\-processors\fR NUMBER
use NUMBER processors.  By default will use the number of processors available.
.TP
\fB\-mem\fR SIZE
use SIZE physical memory for caches.  Use K, M or G to specify Kbytes, Mbytes or Gbytes respectively.  Default 512 Mbytes.
.TP
\fB\-mem\-percent\fR PERCENT
use PERCENT physical memory for caches.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR BYTES, \fB\-offset\fR BYTES
skip BYTES at start of FILESYSTEM.  Optionally a suffix of K, M or G can be given to specify Kbytes, Mbytes or Gbytes respectively (default 0 bytes).
.TP
\fB\-ig\fR, \fB\-ignore\-errors\fR
treat errors writing files to stdout as non\-fatal.
.TP
\fB\-st\fR, \fB\-strict\-errors\fR
treat all errors as fatal.
.TP
\fB\-no\-exit\fR, \fB\-no\-exit\-code\fR
don't set exit code (to nonzero) on non\-fatal errors.
.SS "Filter options:"
.TP
\fB\-no\-wild\fR, \fB\-no\-wildcards\fR
do not use wildcard matching in filenames.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-regex\fR
treat filenames as POSIX regular expressions rather than use the default shell wildcard expansion (globbing).
.SS "Help options:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-help\fR
print help summary information to stdout.
.TP
\fB\-help\-option\fR REGEX
print the help information for options matching REGEX to pager (or stdout if not a terminal).
.TP
\fB\-help\-section\fR SECTION
print the help information for section SECTION to pager (or stdout if not a terminal).  If SECTION does not exactly match a section name, it is treated as a regular expression, and all section names that match are displayed.  Use "sections" or "h" as section name to get a list of sections and their names.
.TP
\fB\-help\-all\fR
print help information for all Sqfscat options and sections to pager (or stdout if not a terminal).
.TP
\fB\-ho\fR REGEX
shorthand alternative to \fB\-help\-option\fR.
.TP
\fB\-hs\fR SECTION
shorthand alternative to \fB\-help\-section\fR.
.TP
\fB\-ha\fR
shorthand alternative to \fB\-help\-all\fR.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.TP
0
The file or files were output to stdout OK.
.TP
1
FATAL errors occurred, e.g. filesystem corruption, I/O errors.  Sqfscat did not continue and aborted.
.TP
2
Non\-fatal errors occurred, e.g. not a regular file, or failed to resolve pathname.  Sqfscat continued and did not abort.
.PP
See \fB\-ignore\-errors\fR, \fB\-strict\-errors\fR and \fB\-no\-exit\-code\fR options for how they affect
the exit status.
.SH "DECOMPRESSORS AVAILABLE"
gzip, lzo, lz4, xz, zstd
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
SQFS_CMDLINE
If set, this is used as the directory to write the file sqfs_cmdline which contains the command line arguments given to Sqfscat.  Each command line argument is wrapped in quotes to ensure there is no ambiguity when arguments contain spaces.  If the file already exists then the command line is appended to the file.
.TP
PAGER
If set, this is used as the name of the program used to display the help text.  The value can be a simple command or a pathname.  The default is \fI\,/usr/bin/pager\/\fP.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
sqfscat IMAGE.SQFS hello
Output the contents of "hello" to stdout.
.TP
sqfscat IMAGE.SQFS hello world
Output the contents of "hello" and then "world" to stdout.
.TP
sqfscat IMAGE.SQFS "*.[ch]"
Output the contents of all the files in the root directory that match the
wildcard *.[ch], to stdout, e.g.  hello.c, hello.h, world.c, world.h.
.PP
Note: when passing wildcarded names to Sqfscat, they should be quoted (as in
the above examples), to ensure that they are not processed by the shell.
