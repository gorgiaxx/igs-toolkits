.SH NAME
unsquashfs - tool to uncompress, extract and list squashfs filesystems
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B unsquashfs
[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR] \fI\,FILESYSTEM \/\fR[\fI\,files to extract or exclude (with -excludes) or cat (with -cat )\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.
It uses either gzip/xz/lzo/lz4/zstd compression to compress both files, inodes
and directories.  Inodes in the system are very small and all blocks are
packed to minimise data overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported
up to a maximum of 1Mbytes (default block size 128K).

Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained
block device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low overhead is
needed.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "Filesystem extraction (filtering) options:"
.TP
\fB\-d\fR PATHNAME, \fB\-dest\fR PATHNAME
extract to PATHNAME, default "squashfs\-root". This option also sets the prefix used when listing the filesystem.
.TP
\fB\-max\fR LEVELS, \fB\-max\-depth\fR LEVELS
descend at most LEVELS of directories when extracting.
.TP
\fB\-excludes\fR
treat files on command line as exclude files.
.TP
\fB\-ex\fR, \fB\-exclude\-list\fR
list of files to be excluded, terminated with ; e.g. file1 file2 ;.
.TP
\fB\-extract\-file\fR FILE
list of directories or files to extract.  One per line.
.TP
\fB\-exclude\-file\fR FILE
list of directories or files to exclude.  One per line.
.TP
\fB\-match\fR
abort if any extract file does not match on anything, and can not be resolved.  Implies \fB\-missing\-symlinks\fR and \fB\-no\-wildcards\fR.
.TP
\fB\-follow\fR, \fB\-follow\-symlinks\fR
follow symlinks in extract files, and add all files/symlinks needed to resolve extract file. Implies \fB\-no\-wildcards\fR.
.TP
\fB\-missing\fR, \fB\-missing\-symlinks\fR
Unsquashfs will abort if any symlink can't be resolved in \fB\-follow\-symlinks\fR.
.TP
\fB\-no\-wild\fR, \fB\-no\-wildcards\fR
do not use wildcard matching in extract and exclude names.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-regex\fR
treat extract names as POSIX regular expressions rather than use the default shell wildcard expansion (globbing).
.TP
\fB\-all\fR TIME, \fB\-all\-time\fR TIME
set all file timestamps to TIME, rather than the time stored in the filesystem inode.  TIME can be an unsigned 32\-bit int indicating seconds since the epoch (1970\-01\-01) or a string value which is passed to the "date" command to parse. Any string value which the date command recognises can be used such as "now", "last week", or "Wed Feb 15 21:02:39 GMT 2023".
.TP
\fB\-cat\fR
cat the files on the command line to stdout.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-force\fR
if destination directory already exists, descend into it and any sub\-directories, and unlink (delete) files if they already exist before extracting to them.
.TP
\fB\-pf\fR FILE
output a pseudo file equivalent of the input Squashfs filesystem, use \- for stdout.
.SS "Filesystem information and listing options:"

list filesystem with file attributes (like ls \fB\-l\fR output), but do not extract files.
.TP
\fB\-lln\fR, \fB\-llnumeric\fR

use UTC rather than local time zone when displaying time.
.TP
\fB\-mkfs\-time\fR

.TP
0
The filesystem listed or extracted OK.
.TP
1
FATAL errors occurred, e.g. filesystem corruption, I/O errors. Unsquashfs did not continue and aborted.
.TP
2
Non\-fatal errors occurred, e.g. no support for XATTRs, Symbolic links in output filesystem or couldn't write permissions to output filesystem. Unsquashfs continued and did not abort.
.PP
See \fB\-ignore\-errors\fR, \fB\-strict\-errors\fR and \fB\-no\-exit\-code\fR options for how they affect
the exit status.
.SH "DECOMPRESSORS AVAILABLE"
gzip, lzo, lz4, xz, zstd
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
SQFS_CMDLINE
If set, this is used as the directory to write the file sqfs_cmdline which contains the command line arguments given to Unsquashfs.  Each command line argument is wrapped in quotes to ensure there is no ambiguity when arguments contain spaces.  If the file already exists then the command line is appended to the file.
.TP
PAGER
If set, this is used as the name of the program used to display the help text.  The value can be a simple command or a pathname.  The default is \fI\,/usr/bin/pager\/\fP.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
unsquashfs IMAGE.SQFS
Extract IMAGE.SQFS to "squashfs-root" in the current working directory.
.TP
unsquashfs -d output IMAGE.SQFS
Extract IMAGE.SQFS to "output" in the current working directory.
.TP
unsquashfs -d . IMAGE.SQFS
Extract IMAGE.SQFS to current working directory.
.TP
unsquashfs -linfo IMAGE.SQFS
Output a listing of IMAGE.SQFS with file attributes to stdout, while extracting
the filesystem to "squashfs-root".
.TP
unsquashfs -lls IMAGE.SQFS
Output a listing of IMAGE.SQFS with file attributes to stdout, but do not
extract the filesystem.  The listing will be prefixed with "squashfs-root".
.TP
unsquashfs -d "" -lls IMAGE.SQFS
Output a listing of IMAGE.SQFS with file attributes to stdout, but do not
extract the filesystem.  The listing will not be prefixed with "squashfs-root".
.TP
unsquashfs IMAGE.SQFS fs/squashfs
Extract only the "fs/squashfs" directory.
.TP
unsquashfs IMAGE.SQFS "[Tt]est/example*"
Extract all files beginning with "example" inside top level directories
called "Test" or "test".
.TP
unsquashfs -excludes IMAGE.SQFS "test/*data*.gz"
This will extract everything except for files that match *data*.gz in the
test directory.  The -excludes option tells Unsquashfs to exclude the files
on the command line rather than extract them.
.TP
unsquashfs -excludes IMAGE.SQFS "... *.gz"
This will extract everything except for files that match *.gz anywhere
in the image.   The "..." means this is a non-anchored exclude which
matches anywhere.
.TP
unsquashfs -ex "test/*data*.gz" \; IMAGE.SQFS test
This uses both extract and exclude options, to tell Unsquashfs to only
extract the "test" directory, and to exclude any files within it that
match *data*.gz.
.TP
unsquashfs -ex "... *.gz" IMAGE.SQFS test
This uses both extract and exclude options, to tell Unsquashfs to only
extract the "test" directory, and to exclude files which match "*.gz"
anywhere within "test" directory or sub-directories.
.TP
unsquashfs -dest output -max-depth 2 IMAGE.SQFS
Extract only the top two levels of IMAGE.SQFS to "output" directory.
.TP
unsquashfs -max-depth 2 IMAGE.SQFS "test/*.gz"
Only extract the gzipped files in the test directory.
.TP
unsquashfs -llc -max-depth 2 IMAGE.SQFS "test/*.gz"
Output a listing of the gzipped files in the test directory to stdout,
but do not extract them.
.TP
unsquashfs -no-xattrs IMAGE.SQFS
Do not extract any extended attributes.  Any extended attributes in the
filesystem will be ignored.
.TP
unsquashfs -xattrs-include "^user." IMAGE.SQFS
Filter the extended attributes and only extract extended attributes in the
user namespace from the Squashfs filesystem.
.TP
unsquashfs -xattrs-exclude "^user." IMAGE.SQFS
Filter the extended attributes and do not extract any extended attributes in
the user namespace from the Squashfs filesystem.
.PP
Note: when passing wildcarded names to Unsquashfs, they should be quoted (as in
the above examples), to ensure that they are not processed by the shell.
