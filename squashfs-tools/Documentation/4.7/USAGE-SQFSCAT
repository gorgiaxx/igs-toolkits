	SQFSCAT - A tool to output files to stdout

This file describes how to use Sqfscat, and it has the following sections:


1. Introduction and basic usage
2. Getting help and displaying Sqfscat options
3. errors and exit code

1. INTRODUCTION AND BASIC USAGE
-------------------------------

Sqfscat allows you to "cat" files to STDOUT from a Squashfs filesystem
without mounting it.  It can read all official Squashfs filesystems.

Sqfscat uses the following arguments

sqfscat [OPTIONS] FILESYSTEM [list of files to cat to stdout]

Where FILESYSTEM is the name of the input Squashfs filesystem.  This can be a
file or a block device.

The most simple usage is to give a filesystem and file to cat on the command
line:

% sqfscat image.sqfs dir/file

This will cat the contents of file "/dir/file" to stdout.

example 2:

Multiple files can be specified on command line, and they will be
output in turn to stdout.

% sqfscat image.sqfs file1 file2

If any of the files given on the command line does not result in a regular file,
Sqfscat will throw an error, but will continue to output the remaining
files on the command line.  This follows the behaviour of "cat", for example:

% sqfscat image.sqfs dir Hello_World
cat: /dir is a directory
Hello World!

example 3:

Sqfscat supports wildcards and it will output the contents of any file that
matches, e.g.

% sqfscat image.sqfs "*.[ch]"

Will output the contents of all the files in the root directory that match the
wildcard *.[ch], to stdout, for example hello.c, hello.h, world.c, world.h.

Note: when passing wildcarded names to Sqfscat, they should be quoted (as in
the above example), to ensure that they are not processed by the shell.

2. GETTING HELP AND DISPLAYING SQFSCAT OPTIONS
----------------------------------------------

Sfscat has fairly detailed built-in help information describing the
available options.  Running:

% sqfscat -help

Will display the following summary of the help options and information
available:

*******************************************************************
SYNTAX: sqfscat [OPTIONS] FILESYSTEM [list of files to cat to stdout]

  "sqfscat -help-option <regex>" to get help on all options matching <regex>

*******************************************************************

2.2. PAGER environment variable
-------------------------------

By default the tools try pager, /usr/bin/pager, less, /usr/bin/less, more,
/usr/bin/more, cat and /usr/bin/cat in that order.

The pager used can be over-ridden using the PAGER environment variable.  If the
filename given by PAGER doesn't contain slashes, the PATH environment variable
will be used to locate it, otherwise it will be treated as a pathname.

3. ERRORS and EXIT CODE
-----------------------

If Sqfscat encounters fatal errors such as I/O error, filesystem corruption,
it will abort immediately, and return an exit code of 1.

If it skipped a file because it wasn't a regular file, or it wasn't in the
filesystem, it will return an exit code of 2.

Otherwise a success exit code of 0 will be returned.
